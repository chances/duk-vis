# DukVis

A JavaScript driven music visualizer powered by lots of useful C++ libraries:

* [Duktape](https://github.com/svaarala/duktape) - a Lua-like embeddable JavaScript engine
* [Cinder](github.com/cinder/Cinder) - a peer-reviewed, free, open source C++ library for creative coding.
* [RxCpp](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxCpp) - Reactive Extensions for C++

### Getting started was configuration hell...

<small>Another painful foray into the depths of wrangling C++</small>

Dependencies, includes, frameworks, oh my!
